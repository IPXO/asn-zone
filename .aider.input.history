+Task: Light design pass using Tailwind (no breaking changes).

# 2025-08-30 17:33:17.308095
+Please:

# 2025-08-30 17:33:32.907903
+1) Update apps/web/tailwind.config.(js|ts) (whichever exists) to:

# 2025-08-30 17:34:15.017690
+   - ensure darkMode: 'class'

# 2025-08-30 17:34:40.171403
+   - extend theme:

# 2025-08-30 17:35:22.783924
+       container: { center: true, padding: '1rem', screens: { '2xl': '64rem' } }

# 2025-08-30 17:36:12.163614
+       fontFamily: set sans to system-ui stack if not present

# 2025-08-30 17:37:23.279977
+       colors: keep Tailwind defaults; do NOT rename existing color tokens

# 2025-08-30 17:38:14.450247
+2) Update apps/web/app/globals.css:

# 2025-08-30 17:38:44.952213
+   - Ensure @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities exist once.

# 2025-08-30 17:39:32.505763
+   - Add a small base layer polish:

# 2025-08-30 17:40:13.606313
+       * html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }

# 2025-08-30 17:40:45.439962

+       * a { @apply underline-offset-2; }

# 2025-08-30 17:42:28.369872
+   - Do not change layout.tsx body classes (dark mode is handled there already).

# 2025-08-30 17:43:16.232643
